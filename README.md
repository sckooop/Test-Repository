# Test-Repository
This is a Repository that I am creating to get used to GitHub


Hi everybody!

A group I just joined is using this as a tool to help manage projects, so I am here on this to learn more about it. 

I also think it might end up being very helpful for a project at work that I just got put on, so hopefully this is a duel puprose learning excercise.
